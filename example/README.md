# Examples

Define your NeoPixel strip in linearFade.h for each example, then upload to demo.

Each RGBW pixel in a fade will update at different intervals depending on the average of how many steps they need to make it to their target value. Because of this, you can sometimes see individual pixel changes. To minimize this, you can turn down the string brightness.
